        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage,
                    mushrooms, onions, green bell pepper, and garlic in hot oil until sausage is browned
                    and crumbly, about 20 minutes; drain and discard grease.</li>
                <li>Stir tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and olives into sausage mixture.
                    season with oregano, basil, and salt. Simmer mixtures until flavors infuse, about 30 minutes. </li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally
                    until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a serving bowl; top with
                    tomato-sausage sauce and Parmesan cheese.</li>
