            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, 
                        stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, 
                        and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 
                        milk and broth in flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine 
                        into sauce and remove from heat. Stir parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.</li>
                    <li>White ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.</li>
                    <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saut√© carrots, zucchini,
                        and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.</li>
                    <li>Layer 1/3 lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the parmesan sauce in a 9x13 inch baking dish; repeat 
                        laying 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
